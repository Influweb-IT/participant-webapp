## What is Influweb.it?<br>
It is a voluntary participatory system for monitoring influenza and COVID-19 in Italy. It was created in 2008 to monitor the circulation of seasonal influenza among people who donâ€™t visit a doctor for their symptoms and it has been extended to monitor COVID-19 since early 2020.
It is based on an online platform, of which people from the general population are the protagonists: anybody can actively participate, providing weekly updates on their health status, even if no symptoms are experienced.

## Why Influweb.it?<br>

We know that many people who become infected with the seasonal influenza and now the new coronavirus have mild or few symptoms and do not go to the doctor. In the case of COVID-19, not everyone is tested. This makes it difficult to track how the disease, being it the seasonal flu or the new coronavirus is circulating in our country. With the help of people from all over Italy we can collect this information in a more effective way and use it to complement the data collected by the national institute of health through traditional healthcare system approaches.<br>
Together we can keep a close watch on what is going on!

## How does Influweb.it work?<br>
People who have registered as participants in Influweb report once a week to the platform whether they have had a fever or other symptoms in the past week. This allows us to monitor the health status directly from the general population and also how the situation develops over time. After the registration, participants can compile an initial intake survey with questions about their background: work, age, existing diseases and conditions etc. They will then receive an email every week asking if they have had any symptoms in the past week and if so, which ones: a runny nose, coughing, sneezing, a high temperature and so on. It is important for the questionnaire to be completed even if a participant has no symptoms. If this is the case, it takes about 30 seconds to answer the questions; if there are symptoms it takes about 3 to 5 minutes.
We will use this data to study how the disease spreads. In the future, this research will also be useful for other viruses and infectious diseases, as it has been shown for seasonal influenza and COVID-19.
