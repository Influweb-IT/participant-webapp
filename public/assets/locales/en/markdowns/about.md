**Why Influweb?**

We know that many people who become infected with influenza-like viruses such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus (‘coronavirus’ as it is popularly known) have mild or few symptoms and do not go to the doctor. With the help of volunteers like you we have a better chance of monitoring what's happening.

**How does Influweb work?**

Participants receive an initial registration form with questions about their background, age and existing diseases and conditions. Following this they receive an email every week with a link to a questionnaire asking what symptoms they have had in the past week: a runny nose, coughing, sneezing, a high temperature and so on. The questionnaire must be completed even if the participant has no symptoms. It takes about 30 seconds to complete the questionnaire if the participant has no symptoms, and about 3 to 5 minutes if he or she has symptoms. 

The completion of the questionnaire enables us to monitor how certain symptoms are distributed across Italy and changes in this pattern over time. These data will be used for scientific research into the spread of influenza-like illnesses. In the future, that research will also be useful for other viruses and infectious diseases.

**Data**

The data are collected and processed exclusively for the following purposes:

- Carrying out scientific research and statistical analyses on the spread of infectious diseases in Italy and Europe;

- Publishing statistical analyses, including graphical representations of the results;

- Providing you, the user, with information about the survey results (for example: how many registered users in your region have flu or other infectious diseases);

The personal data that we may process for these purposes are: 

- Year of birth, month of birth, postcode, gender, family composition;

- Background data relevant to the risk of infection, i.e. data about whether you belong to a risk group recommended for flu vaccination, occupation and lifestyle;

- Data about symptoms provided in the symptoms questionnaire;

We would also like to inform you that we will process your data in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations and with full respect for your rights and in particular your privacy.

**Who can take part?**

Anyone who lives in Italy and is 18 years or older can participate in the study on a voluntary basis. To ensure that information about the spread of influenza-like diseases is also obtained for children and young people, the parents or guardians of a minor can also complete the questionnaires on behalf of their child. This is not mandatory, but it will contribute to the research. 

**Taking part**

Your participation in this study is voluntary and you can withdraw from the study at any time without giving a reason. 

The study is funded by the European Union and has been evaluated by an ethics committee. The fact that it has been funded and approved does not mean that you should feel obliged to participate.
